MLIR Compilation process
Source -> AST -> MLIR -> Lowering -> Passes -> LLVMIR -> run

Chapter 1 (Source->AST):
Building and Running Commands (Linux)
cmake --build build --target toyc-ch1
./build/bin/toyc-ch1 mlir/test/Examples/Toy/Ch1/ast.toy -emit=ast

Chapter 2 (AST->MLIR):
Building and Running Commands (Linux)
cmake --build build --target toyc-ch2
./build/bin/toyc-ch2 mlir/test/Examples/Toy/Ch2/ast.toy -emit=ast

In MLIR, Operations are the core unit of abstraction and computation, similar in many ways to LLVM instructions. Operations can have application-specific semantics and can be used to represent all of the core IR structures in LLVM: instructions, globals (like functions), modules, etc.

Chapter 3:
Building and Running Commands (Linux)
cmake --build build --target toyc-ch3
./build/bin/toyc-ch3 mlir/test/Examples/Toy/Ch3/trivial_reshape.toy -emit=mlir
